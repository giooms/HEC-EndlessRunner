# HEC-EndlessRunner
## Introduction 
This game has been made for the project in the **Management-oriented programming** course given by M. Schyns.

It has been made by **Thomas Fredrich**, **Marie Goffin**, **Héloïse Hulstaert**, **Nathan geudens** and I (**Gilles Ooms**).

## How to play
The game is currently available in a web-version here (*we recommend using a computer*): [HEC-EndlessRunner](https://giooms.github.io/endlessrunner.html)

You will be able to choose between 6 maps representing important places at **HEC Liège**.

These are: 
  - The New Building
  - The 050 Auditorium
  - The 030 Auditorium
  - HEC Entrance Hall
  - The Gardens
  - The (student-led) Cafet

After that, you will be able to choose your avatar. These represent the coding team. 


Once the Game is launched, try to survive as long as possible without falling off the platforms or running into the mobs. (My personal high-score is *206*)

### To jump, press the **space bar**. 

As soon as the game is over, you can start over or decide to change your Avatar or the map you play on. 

## Enjoy!

NB: If you play the game inside Unity, make sure to start from the chooseMap Scene.
